# What is Cucumber ?

Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It offers a way to write tests that anybody can understand, regardless of their technical knowledge. In BDD, users (business analysts, product owners) first write scenarios or acceptance tests that describe the behavior of the system from the customer’s perspective, for review and sign-off by the product owners before developers write their codes.

## why we use cucumber framework ?
To help implement BDD, one of the most popular open-source tools is Cucumber. It allows for creating higher-level specifications or scenarios that can be run and tested using Gherkin—a natural language programming platform. At their core, these scenarios are written in a human-readable format called Given-When-Then. Here’s how:

Given:A customer wants to buy a specific product.

When:Customer enters the required parameters: Product name, the quantity of product, customer location to deliver the product

Then:The customer will see the preview of the product with its price and a button to buy it.

The good thing about the Cucumber testing framework is that it breaks down feature design and implementation into small, manageable steps. It helps identify the best solution for an issue, and if there’s no solution, the test is simply broken.

This is how a project becomes less ambiguous and more reliable over time. Besides, the test can be scaled per the needs and understanding exhibited by cross-functional teams.
## Advantages of Cucumber Framework

Cucumber automation tool is definitely an efficient testing tool. Cucumber is an exceptionally comprehensive framework that supports BDD in the best way possible. Following are some of its main benefits.

1. Intuitive Way to Express Requirements in Human-Readable Form.
2. Translating Business Requirements into Testable Scenarios.
3. Multi-language Support
4. The Role of Cucumber in Agile Projects
5. The Facility of Code Reusability
